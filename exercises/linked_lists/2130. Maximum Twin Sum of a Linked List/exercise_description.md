## Problem Description

Given the `head` of a singly linked list, group all the nodes with odd indices together followed by the nodes with even indices, and return _the reordered list_.

The **first** node is considered **odd**, and the **second** node is **even**, and so on.

Note that the relative order inside both the even and odd groups should remain as it was in the input.

You must solve the problem in `O(1)` extra space complexity and `O(n)` time complexity.

## Examples

**Example 1:**

![Example 1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/10/oddeven-linked-list.jpg)  
**Input:** head = [1,2,3,4,5]  
**Output:** [1,3,5,2,4]

**Example 2:**

![Example 2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/10/oddeven2-linked-list.jpg)  
**Input:** head = [2,1,3,5,6,4,7]  
**Output:** [2,3,6,7,1,5,4]

## Constraints

- The number of nodes in the linked list is in the range `[0, 10^4]`.
- `-10^6 <= Node.val <= 10^6`
