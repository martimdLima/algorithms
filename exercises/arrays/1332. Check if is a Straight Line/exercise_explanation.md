# Understanding the Problem

The goal is to determine if a series of points in a graph lie on a straight line. This requires checking if all the points are collinear, meaning they all satisfy a linear equation of the form $y=mx+b$ with a constant slope between any pair of points.

For a series of points in a graph to lie on a straight line, they must satisfy certain mathematical properties. Here are the key rules and conditions:

1. **Linear Equation**

   The points must satisfy a linear equation of the form $y=mx+b$, where:

   - $y$ is the dependent variable (vertical axis),
   - $x$ is the independent variable (horizontal axis),
   - $m$ is the slope of the line,
   - $b$ is the y-intercept (the value of $y$ when $x=0$),

2. **Constant Slope**

   The slope between any two points must be constant. The slope $ùëö$ between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is calculated as:

   $m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$

   For the points to be collinear (i.e., lie on the same straight line), the slope calculated between any pair of points must be the same.

3. **Collinearity Condition**

   For three points $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$ and $(x_3, y_3)$ to be collinear, the following determinant condition must be zero:

   $
   \begin{vmatrix}
   x_1 & x_2 & x_3 \\
   y_1 & y_2 & y_3 \\
   1 & 1 & 1 \\
   \end{vmatrix} = 0
   $

   Expanding this determinant, we get:

   $x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) = 0$

   If this condition holds true for all triples of points in the series, the points are collinear.

4. **Vector Cross Product**

   In vector terms, three points $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$ and $(x_3, y_3)$ are collinear if the cross product of the vectors $(x_1-x_2,y_2-y_1)$ and $(x_3-x_1,y_3-y_1)$ is zero:

   $(x_1-x_2)(y_3-y_1) - (x_3-x_1)(y_3-y_1)$

# Approach Taken:

1. **Mathematical Check for Collinearity**

   - The solution involves verifying that the slope between any two points is consistent throughout the series.
   - This is done by ensuring that for any three points $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$ and $(x_3, y_3)$, the determinant condition or the cross product method confirms their collinearity.

2. **Python Implementation**

   - A function iterates through the points, comparing the slopes formed by consecutive points.
   - If the slopes are consistent, the points are collinear; otherwise, they are not.
