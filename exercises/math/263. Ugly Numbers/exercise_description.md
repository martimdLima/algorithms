## Problem Description

An **ugly number** is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to $2$, $3$, and $5$.

Given an integer $n$, return `true` if $n$ is an ugly number.

## Examples
- Example 1:
  - Input: n = 6
  - Output: true
  - Explanation: 6 = 2 Ã— 3

- Example 2:
  - Input: n = 1
  - Output: true
  - Explanation: 1 has no prime factors, therefore all of its prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.

- Example 3:
  - Input: n = 14
  - Output: false
  - Explanation: 14 is not ugly since it includes the prime factor 7.

## Constraints
- $-2^{31} \leq n \leq 2^{31} - 1$
