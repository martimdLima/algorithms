# Understanding the Problem

We are looking for the number of ways to write \( n \) as a sum of consecutive positive integers. This can be derived from the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.

## Step-by-Step Derivation

1. **Sum of Consecutive Integers**
   
   The sum $S$ of $K$ consecutive integers starting from $a$:

   $$
   S = a + (a + 1) + (a + 2) + \ldots + (a + k - 1)
   $$

2. **Sum of an Arithmetic Series**

   This series can be written using the formula for the sum of the first $k$ terms of an arithmetic sequence:

   $$
   S = \frac{k}{2} \left[ 2a + (k - 1) \right]
   $$

3. **Set $S$ to $n$**

   Since we want the sum to equal $n$:

   $$
   n = \frac{k}{2} \left[ 2a + (k - 1) \right]
   $$

4. **Isolate the Terms Involving $a$**

   We need to find pairs $(a, k)$ that satisfy the equation above:

   $$
   2n = k(2a + k - 1)
   $$

   $$
   \frac{2n}{k} = 2a + k - 1
   $$

5. **Rearrange to Solve for $a4**

   Solving for $a4:

   $$
   2a = \frac{2n}{k} - k + 1
   $$

   $$
   a = \frac{\frac{2n}{k} - k + 1}{2}
   $$

   $$
   a = \left( \frac{2n}{k} - k + 1 \right) / 2 = \frac{\left( 2n - k^2 + k \right)}{k} / 2
   $$

   $$
   a = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2n - k^2 + k}{k}
   $$

   $$
   a = \frac{2n - k^2 + k}{2k}
   $$


# Approach  
We can iterate over possible values of $𝑘$ k and check if 2 $𝑛$ 2n divided by $𝑘$ k leaves a remainder of 0, and if the resulting  $𝑎$  a is a positive integer.

1. **Numerator**  
The term $$ \frac{\frac{2n}{k} - k + 1}{2} $$ represents the numerator after simplifying the equation for $a$  If this is even, then $a$ can be a positive integer.

2. **Denominator**  
The term 2 in the denominator ensures that $𝑎$ remains an integer after division.

3. **Loop Condition**  
The loop continues as long as $k(k+1)< 2n$, ensuring that we are within valid bounds.
